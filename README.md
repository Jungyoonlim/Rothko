# 🎨 Rothko: AI Drawing and Painting Studio 🖌️

Rothko is an AI-powered creative platform, inspired by the fluid and emotion-driven artistry of Mark Rothko. It's a bridge between your unique vision and the boundless potential of artificial intelligence.

### Intuitive Pattern Recognition 🕵️‍♂️

Just as Mark Rothko sought to express raw emotion, our AI learns from the emotional undertones and patterns in your work. It doesn't just recognize shapes and colors, but the essence of your artistic style, generating suggestions to complement and expand your vision.

### Pattern Recognition 🕵️‍♂️

The AI uses advanced pattern recognition algorithms to identify patterns and themes in the current state of the canvas. This allows the software to understand the artist's style and preferences, and generate suggestions that align with their unique artistic vision.

### Environmental Adaptation 🌍

Rothko's AI also features environmental adaptation capabilities. It can adapt the identified patterns based on the environment, allowing the art to evolve and change with the world around it. This feature will be further enhanced in the future with the integration of APIs to get environmental data.

## 🎁 Suggestions

Rothko's AI can generate suggestions based on the current state of the canvas. These suggestions are adapted based on the environment, providing the artist with unique and personalized ideas to enhance their artwork.
